qSearch is a QGIS plugin. It produces a friendly interface to perform and save searches in a layer.


Changelog:
1.2:   - Using show instead of exec_ to display the dialog: this allows to interact with Qgis while qSearch dialog is open
1.1:   - Added confirmation to delete fields with no aliases when switching
       - Fixed bug when switching alias mode
       - Fixed bug when the current project is empty
1.0.1: - Fixed bug when removing an item in the search
